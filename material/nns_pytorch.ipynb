    "Traditional machine learning methods, like logistic regression, are often sufficient for datasets that are linearly separable. However, more complex problems, such as image recognition and natural language understanding/processing (NLU/P), sometimes demand a more intricate approach. Neural networks, which incorporate additional layers, excel at learning non-linear relationships. These extra layers, known as *hidden* layers, process the input into one or more intermediate forms before generating the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression achieves this transformation using a single fully-connected layer. We can think of this as a Single-Layer Perceptron (although, please don't call it that). This layer performs a linear transformation (a matrix multiplication combined with a bias). In contrast, a neural network with multiple connected layers is typically referred to as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). For instance, in the simple MLP shown below, a 4-dimensional input is mapped to a 5-dimensional hidden representation, which is subsequently transformed into a single output used for prediction. This is a \"simple\" architecture: A so-called artificial neural network. \n",

    "#### Nonlinearities revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinearities are usually applied between the layers of a neural network. As discussed in class 2, there are several reasons for this. A key reason is that without any nonlinearity, a sequence of linear transformations (fully connected layers) reduces to a single linear transformation, limiting the model's expressiveness to that of a single layer. Including nonlinearities between layers prevents this reduction, enabling neural networks to approximate far more complex functions. This is what makes neural networks so powerful.\n",

    "#### Why neural networks?\n",
    "The real power of neural networks lies in their ability to deal with problems that aren’t simple. A lot of traditional methods, like logistic regression, are limited to drawing straight lines (linear decision boundaries) to separate data. That works well if your data happens to fall neatly into two groups, like the example on the left below. But in real life, things are rarely that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../media/nonlinearity.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Take the example on the right. The data - 2D for simplicity, although most datasets will have many more features - isn’t linearly separable - you can’t just draw one straight line and call it a day. Neural networks solve this by stacking layers with nonlinear activation functions, allowing them to reshape the input data into something more manageable. They essentially learn to create these complex boundaries (like the curved line on the right) that let us separate data no matter how messy it is. This ability to handle non-linearity is what makes neural networks so effective for tasks like recognizing images, processing speech, or understanding language.\n",

    "These plots show the training and validation loss (left) and accuracy (right) over the course of training epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both training and validation loss steadily decrease and remain closely aligned throughout the epochs. This indicates that the model is learning effectively without signs of overfitting. We also see that training and validation accuracy show consistent improvement over epochs, eventually plateauing as they converge. This suggests stable training and good generalization to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the trend suggest that we could train for more epochs to improve the model's performance. Since this is a demo example, we will let it rest for now but feel free to experiment with the number of epochs and other hyperparameters to see how they affect the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How to handle overfitting\n",
    "While we don't overfit the training data in this example, it's a common problem in deep learning. Overfitting occurs when the model learns to perform well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. This can happen when the model is too complex or when the training data is limited. Essentially, it becomes economical for the model to memorize the training data rather than learn general patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common strategies to prevent overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights and reducing model complexity. In PyTorch, we can add regularization to the optimizer using the `weight_decay` parameter, like so\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01, weight_decay=0.001)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dropout layers**: Dropout layers randomly set a fraction of input units to zero during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific neurons. We can add dropout layers to our model using `nn.Dropout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# other layers\n",
    "nn.Dropout(0.5)\n",
    "# other layers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Early stopping**: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set and stop training when performance starts to degrade. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data.\n"
