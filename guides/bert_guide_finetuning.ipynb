    "# BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n",

    "\n",
    "* Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ([Devlin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) is a deep learning model developed by Google AI Language that significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). <br><br>\n",
    "* Many subsequent models, such as RoBERTa ([Liu et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)), ALBERT ([Lan et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942)), and DistilBERT ([Sanh et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)), have built upon BERT’s architecture, improving efficiency and performance.<br><br>\n",
    "* The original BERT model was introduced in 2018, following OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-1) ([Radford et al., 2018](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf)). Both models were based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), but they took different approaches: while GPT is a unidirectional model designed for Natural Language Generation (NLG), BERT introduced bidirectional self-attention to improve contextual understanding in NLU tasks. <br><br>\n",
    "* These two architectures played a pivotal role in modern NLP, with BERT influencing retrieval-based models and GPT evolving into more advanced generative AI systems such as the breakthrough of GPT-3 ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)) and ChatGPT.<br><br>\n",
    "* BERT has seen wide industry applications. For example, Google [integrated BERT into its search algorithms](https://snorkel.ai/large-language-models/bert-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to better understand user queries, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant search results. Other companies, [like Wayfair](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-innovation/bert-does-business-implementing-the-bert-model-for-natural-language-processing-at-wayfair?utm_source=chatgpt.com), have implemented BERT to analyze customer messages, enabling more efficient and accurate responses. <br><br>\n",
    "* While highly effective for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), BERT is computationally expensive, limited to a 512-token context window, lacks generative capabilities, and inherits biases from its pretraining data, making it less suitable for real-time, long-document, or dynamically evolving knowledge tasks. Perfect for some tasks, but not all.<br><br>\n",
    "* In December 2024, [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.13663) was introduced as a state-of-the-art encoder-only model, offering significant improvements over previous architectures. It supports sequences up to 8,192 tokens and incorporates modern enhancements like Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) and Flash Attention for improved performance and efficiency..<br><br>\n",

    "[ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/modernbert) is a state-of-the-art encoder-only model that builds upon the original BERT architecture. Introduced in December 2024, ModernBERT offers several key improvements over its predecessor, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased Sequence Length**: ModernBERT can handle sequences up to 8,192 tokens, compared to BERT’s 512-token limit. This makes it more suitable for long-document tasks and other applications that require processing large amounts of text.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**: ModernBERT uses rotary positional embeddings to encode positional information in the input sequence. This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies more effectively and improves performance on tasks that require understanding of sequential relationships.<br><br>\n",
    "- **Flash Attention**: ModernBERT incorporates Flash Attention, a novel attention mechanism that improves efficiency and reduces computational complexity. Flash Attention is designed to be more memory-efficient than traditional self-attention mechanisms, making it well-suited for large-scale language tasks.<br><br>"
