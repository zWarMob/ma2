    "* Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) ([Devlin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) is a deep learning model developed by Google AI Language that significantly advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in Natural Language Understanding (NLU). <br><br>\n",
    "* Many subsequent models, such as RoBERTa ([Liu et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692)), ALBERT ([Lan et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942)), and DistilBERT ([Sanh et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108)), have built upon BERT’s architecture, improving efficiency and performance.<br><br>\n",
    "* The original BERT model was introduced in 2018, following OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-1) ([Radford et al., 2018](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf)). Both models were based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), but they took different approaches: while GPT is a unidirectional model designed for Natural Language Generation (NLG), BERT introduced bidirectional self-attention to improve contextual understanding in NLU tasks. <br><br>\n",
    "* These two architectures played a pivotal role in modern NLP, with BERT influencing retrieval-based models and GPT evolving into more advanced generative AI systems such as the breakthrough of GPT-3 ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)) and ChatGPT.<br><br>\n",
    "* BERT has seen wide industry applications. For example, Google [integrated BERT into its search algorithms](https://snorkel.ai/large-language-models/bert-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) to better understand user queries, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant search results. Other companies, [like Wayfair](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/tech-innovation/bert-does-business-implementing-the-bert-model-for-natural-language-processing-at-wayfair?utm_source=chatgpt.com), have implemented BERT to analyze customer messages, enabling more efficient and accurate responses. <br><br>\n",
    "* While highly effective for Natural Language Understanding (NLU), BERT is computationally expensive, limited to a 512-token context window, lacks generative capabilities, and inherits biases from its pretraining data, making it less suitable for real-time, long-document, or dynamically evolving knowledge tasks. Perfect for some tasks, but not all.<br><br>\n",
    "* In December 2024, [ModernBERT](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.13663) was introduced as a state-of-the-art encoder-only model, offering significant improvements over previous architectures.

    "In 2017, the Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) with the publication of the paper \"*Attention Is All You Need*\" by Vaswani et al.  Unlike older neural network models for language tasks - such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) - the Transformer relies heavily on a mechanism known as **self-attention**. This approach allows the model to focus on different parts of a sentence (or sequence) when encoding its meaning, which was found to drastically improve both training efficiency and performance on large-scale language tasks.\n",

    "* Traditional language models often process text directionally - either left-to-right or right-to-left. This can prevent them from seeing future context when predicting or encoding each token. BERT, however, processes all tokens at once, giving it a **bidirectional** (or “non-directional”) view of the entire sequence.

    "In this step, we’ll convert each text in our dataset into a numerical representation that machine learning models can understand. To do this, we use the `ModernBERT` model, which takes in text and produces embeddings — vectors of numbers that capture the meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT (and ModernBERT) actually creates an embedding for token (each word or subword) in a sentence, but instead of keeping all of them, we’ll extract just one: the embedding of the special `[CLS]` token. As covered in the introduction, this token appears at the beginning of every input and is designed to represent the meaning of the whole sentence. This way, instead of storing a variable number of embeddings for each text, we keep just one fixed-size vector per sentence, making it much easier to work with in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we process the dataset in batches, meaning we send multiple texts through the model at once. This speeds things up, but it also requires more memory. If you run into memory issues, try reducing the batch size (by adjust the `batch_size` parameter in the `map` function). After this step, each entry in our dataset will have an \"embeddings\" field that contains a single vector. The dataset will now look like this:\n",
