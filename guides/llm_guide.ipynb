    "# Generative LLMs: decoder-only Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** are deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They belong to the family of Transformer-based architectures, first introduced in the seminal paper *Attention Is All You Need* ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)), which revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) through self-attention mechanisms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The development of LLMs gained momentum with OpenAI’s *Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-1)* ([Radford et al., 2018](https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf)), which introduced a pretraining-finetuning paradigm for NLP tasks. This approach was later scaled with *GPT-2* ([Radford et al., 2019](https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf)) and *GPT-3* ([Brown et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)), with the latter demonstrating emergent capabilities in zero-shot and few-shot learning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **BERT** ([Devlin et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) played a parallel but pivotal role in advancing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) with bidirectional context modeling. In particular, BERT influenced many retrieval-based applications. Meanwhile, GPT models prioritized *autoregressive decoding*, which revitalized the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG). The bifurcation between *encoder-only* (BERT-like) and *decoder-only* (GPT-like) architectures shapes the evolution of modern NLP systems to this day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scaling Laws** ([Kaplan et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361)) demonstrated that model performance improves logarithmically with increased parameter count, data, and compute. This insight led to the training of massive LLMs, such as *GPT-4* ([OpenAI, 2023](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)), *PaLM* ([Chowdhery et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311)), *Claude* ([Anthropic, 2023](https://www.anthropic.com)), and *Gemini* ([Google DeepMind, 2023](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/)), which exhibit improved reasoning, multilingual capabilities, and tool use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs have been widely adopted in industry, powering chatbots (e.g., *ChatGPT*, *Claude*), code generation tools (e.g., *GitHub Copilot* powered by OpenAI’s *Codex* ([Chen et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374))), and enterprise applications. For example, [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/articles/morgan-stanley-ai-assistant?utm_source=chatgpt.com) uses LLMs to retrieve financial insights, while [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/how-salesforce-ai-assistant-works/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) has integrated LLMs into its AI assistant for customer relationship management (CRM).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Despite their strengths, LLMs have significant limitations: They are compute-intensive, struggle with factual consistency ([Maynez et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03043)), and often hallucinate incorrect information. Efforts to mitigate these issues include RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) ([Christiano et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741)) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) ([Lewis et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)), which combines LLMs with external knowledge sources.  \n",

    "As mentioned above, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a direct result of advancements in Transformer-based neural network architectures, originally introduced in <i>Attention Is All You Need</i> (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">Vaswani et al., 2017</a>). <br><br>While early Transformer models were primarily used for sequence-to-sequence tasks (such as machine translation), modern LLMs - so-called decoder-only LLMs - are capable of human-level natural language generation (NLG) and, arguably, near-human reasoning, dialogue, and tool usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike earlier neural architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers (and by extension, decoder-only LLMs) rely on self-attention mechanisms to dynamically weigh relationships between words in a sequence. Effectively, this means that instead of reading text one word at a time in order (like RNNs) or trying to spot patterns in small chunks (like CNNs), Transformers look at the entire sentence at once and decide which words are most important to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**: Imagine you're reading a mystery novel. Instead of going page by page and only remembering the last few sentences, a Transformer can scan the whole book at once and instantly see connections—like how a clue in Chapter 2 relates to the big reveal in Chapter 20. Much like what humans do when reading a book, Transformers can understand context and meaning across long and complex sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to \"pay attention\" to all words at once makes LLMs much better at understanding context and meaning, even across long and complex sentences. This, however, has it limits.\n",
